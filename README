                           The README file

This is a set of programs that solve the Smoluchowski problems (forward and 
inverse) with fast algorithms of linear algebra. 

To build SmoluchowsliSolver you will need gcc/g++ (of any version you can find
nowadays) and GNU make. Just type 'make' right here (in the same
directory you've found this file) and wait a bit. Binarie 'smolsolver' will
be found in the 'examples/' subdirectory. Yoy can also type 'make all' to
build test files to cross approximation and fast fourier transformation in
'smoluchowski/' subdirecrtory.

Directory structure:
./             - root of all subroutines
./smoluchowski - "library" with solver of Smoluchowski equation
./examples     - directory with example of use SmoluchowskiSolver
./doc          - TODO

Library structure:
./smoluchowski/fft.*       - contains class of Complex numbers and 
    FourieTransform wich can do usual and fast discrete Fourier transform
./smoluchowski/matrix.*    - contains base class to work with matrix and 
    class of matrix wich stored by columns (so you can easy increase columns)
./smoluchowski/indexlist.* - contains class with list of increasing numbers
    wich used in cross approximation
./smoluchowski/cross.*     - contains base class of skeleton decomposition
    with fast matvec functions (full, upper/lower triangular) and class of 
    Cross Approximation
./smoluchowski/solver.*    - contains SmoluchowskiSolver wich can solve
    such forward linear and nonlinear problems as linear adjoint and
    inverse problems
